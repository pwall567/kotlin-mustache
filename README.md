# kotlin-mustache

Minimal Kotlin implementation of Mustache templates.

This is a simple implementation, and it is clearly not a complete implementation of the
[Mustache Specification](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).

More documentation to follow; in the meantime, the tests give examples of the uses of the template system and the
constructions implemented.
